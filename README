* Build
* Using Docker Test Setup
* Installation
Prerequisites - modinput_prometheus plugin - https://github.com/lukemonahan/splunk_modinput_prometheus

* Usage

A Mattermost app should be installed.  
When you access the Mattermost app you will see a dashboard in the horizontal navigation bar.  The other 2 are available under the "Dashboards" tab.

* Contributing
When directly comparing the Mattermost dashboards from Grafana to Splunk, there is much less resolution on the data, but I *think* the general trends match.  More testing is needed.
 This could be improved by

* TODO List
 * Most of the "Mattermost Bonus Metrics" dashboard needs to be created
 * Why are CPU seconds not working?  Confirm again in non-docker setup (or fix docker)
 * Add the other 2 dashboards to the nav bar
 * Fix longer range dashboard view (e.g., 7days... too many data points right now)
 * Re-test 
 * Fix the logo artwork (to have a transparent background?)
 * Improve the "Multi Select" option for hosts to handle the initial load with assuming "All" hosts, and then allow specific selection.


* Future ideas
 * Post alerts and dashboards to channels
 * Add log correlation to the dashboards.
 * Can some of the search span periods be made into a parameter or macro so users can configure the period to match the way the prometheus data inputs are configured in Splunk.
